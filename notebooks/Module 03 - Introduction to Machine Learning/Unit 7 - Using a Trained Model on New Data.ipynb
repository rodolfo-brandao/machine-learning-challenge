    "\n",
    "In Unit 3, we created a basic model that let us find the relationship between a dog's harness size and their boot size. We showed how this model could then be used to make a prediction about a new, previously unseen dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common to build, train, then use a model while we are just learning about machine learning; but in the real world, we don't want to train the model _every time_ we want to make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider our avalanche-dog equipment store scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We want to train the model just once, then load that model onto the server that runs our online store.\n",
    "* Although the model is _trained_ on a dataset we downloaded from the internet, we actually want to _use_ it to estimate the boot size of our customers' dogs who are not in this dataset! \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will:\n",
    "1. Create a basic model\n",
    "2. Save it to disk\n",
    "3. Load it from disk\n",
